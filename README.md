# Group Project – Retake Semester

This project was developed during my retake semester as a collaborative team effort. The main goals were to apply what we had learned about software engineering principles and project management methodologies in a real-world group setting.

## My Role

In this project, I took on a **dual role**:

### 1. Team Coordinator / Manager
- Scheduled and organized group meetings
- Acted as the main point of contact to keep everyone aligned
- Helped maintain focus and ensured the group stayed on track with deadlines
- Encouraged collaborative communication and accountability

### 2. Developer – Scheduling Feature
- Worked directly on the **scheduling functionality** of the application
- Helped design and implement how users could manage events or time-based actions
- Collaborated with teammates to integrate this feature with the rest of the system

This combination of coordination and hands-on development gave me valuable experience managing both people and code.

## Methodologies Practiced

### Waterfall Methodology
- Followed a step-by-step plan from requirements to deployment
- Focused on documentation, task assignment, and milestone-based progress

### Agile Methodology (Introductory Exposure)
- Integrated short feedback loops and regular team check-ins
- Adapted to changes and re-prioritized tasks when necessary
- Practiced iterative development in later project stages

## Key Takeaways

- Gained practical leadership experience in a team setting  
- Improved project planning and time management skills  
- Learned to balance structure with flexibility in a hybrid Waterfall/Agile workflow  
- Strengthened my technical skills through feature implementation

## Technologies Used

- Language: C# / Java / (replace with actual)
- Frontend: (e.g., React / HTML/CSS / etc.)
- Backend: (e.g., ASP.NET Core / Spring Boot / etc.)
- Tools: Visual Studio, GitHub, Trello, Notion

## Collaboration Tools

- **Git/GitHub** for version control  
- **Trello / Notion / Google Sheets** for planning and task tracking  
- **Google Meet / Zoom** for regular group meetings

## What We Built

> We built a simple warehouse managing application for the virtual company "Media Bazaar", the application had scheduling for employees, employee management system and a cargo management system as well

---

## Final Thoughts

This project helped me grow as both a developer and a team player. Taking on the scheduling feature allowed me to dive into the technical side, while my role as coordinator pushed me to improve my soft skills and lead with responsibility.

I’d be happy to walk through the project or explain the scheduling component in more detail.
